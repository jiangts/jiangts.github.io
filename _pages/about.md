Hello!

Iâ€™m a native of North Carolina from the Research Triangle area. I studied CS at Stanford University and am now working on a website to help people sing together online: [EasyVirtualChoir](https://easyvirtualchoir.com).

I chess, code, and math with varying degrees of proficiency. I occasionally swim, sing, and very rarely nowadays, play clarinet.

I suffer from what I imagine is a classic problem for a coder who also fancies himself a writer from time to time. Namely, I have 3 other blogs:

- blog on some things I've been learning in the Bible: https://jiangts.github.io/bible-reflections/
- blog on coding things I find fun: https://jiangts.github.io/dev-blog/
- legacy blog during my early college days: https://jiangts.github.io/blog/
