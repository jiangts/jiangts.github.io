Hello!

I’m a native of North Carolina from the Research Triangle area. I studied CS at Stanford University and am now working on a website to help people sing together online.

I chess, code, and math with varying degrees of proficiency. I occasionally swim, sing, and very rarely nowadays, play clarinet.

If you’d like to reach out, feel free to find me on Twitter @jiangts!
